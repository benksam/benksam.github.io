## Job Search Activities

-----



> **My recent job search activities pick up on earlier preliminary plans and can be summarised as follows:**


> - Getting routine in building up suitable workflows in the development of webapplications along with getting advanced skills in data wrangling that involves more batch processing and automatised processes in reading data (json apis, Eurostat longitudinal datasets with deep levels of stratifications, etc.), all with the intention of making these skills at the service of potential employers.


> **As earlier, this point has been worked on resulting in the following end-products: (1) Additional R-markdown interactive preliminary reports, refer to [my Rpubs account](http://rpubs.com/sambenk).; (2) the creation of many more dashboards that, beyond integrating real-time streaming data by means of API calls and MySQL databases, also make use of Eurostat stratified datasets that call for more complex data wrangling and automating processes (1+ million row-datasets fit for simultaneous batch PCA/Cluster analysis of 50+ stratified samples for hidden information extraction and synthesis). Still, malfunctions spoiled the deployments of all my interactive dashboards, albeit all source codes and datasets can be found at my Github repositories. Please refer to additional information on [Github](https://github.com/benksam?tab=repositories). ** 


> - Keeping the search for suitable job opportunities either as a teacher position that matches my skill or as a data-analyst/research assitant in the social science field. 

> **As before, this point has also been worked on by: (1) sending applications to teacher positions anywhere in Sweden where the needs are present due to my terminating rental contract in a few weeks giving me the freedom to move to my next job location in Sweden; (2) attending the Lund-IT "MÃ¤sse" from the 3. of October 2019, yet with poor job perspectives given the mismatch between my skills (dataanalysis from a statistical/machine learning standpoint that can be concretised using interactive web applications) and the ones asked during the event (more tailored towards web developpers that are well-acquainted with languages such as html/css/java or the like); (3) participating to job interviews, either as a freelancer for the design of interactive web-applications, or as a data-analyst for the pharmaceutical industry in Germany. Both fruitless so far.** 

----

> Likewise, considering the few points above, my job search activities for the coming weeks can be outlined as follows:  

## **Priority 1: Teacher Position along with Freelance Activities**

### **Working as a French/Maths teacher - Designing interactive Webapplications.**

----

> **My freedom of movement due to the termination of my rental contract opens better perspectives to get a faster teacher job anywhere in Sweden where the need arises. At the same time, given the risks of only getting a part-time teacher job that matches my qualifications, continuing dataanalysis projects along with their deployments in the form of interactive web applications would support my efforts towards improving relevant skills that are in demand and in line with the Swedish labour market while at the same time opening the doors for more job opportunities.**   


-----


## **Priority 2: Dataanalysis Internships along with Freelance Activities** 

##### **Working as a Dataanalyst Intern - Designing interactive Webapplications.**


-----


> **My freedom of movement also enables me to consider internship positions where new employers located anywhere in Sweden would be allowed to judge my dataanalysis skills. As mentioned in previous Job Search report, internships in for instance dataanalysis or the participation in research projects in the economics or social science field where machine learning, multivariate analysis or social impact evaluation skills are in demand could be a possibility. This path has not been fully exploited yet given the strong competition in that field, my age as well as my lack of relevant experience being at odds with getting success in finding "normal" jobs. But I remain open and responsive to internships openings in the general field of dataanalysis.**
